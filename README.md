# Comperio - Tutoring Session Booking Platform - Backend

Welcome to the backend part of the Comperio tutoring booking app! This project powers the core functionalities of the platform, handling user authentication, session management, and API endpoints for seamless communication with the frontend. "Comperio" is derived from Latin, symbolizing the pursuit of learning. Users can register/log in as either a student or instructor and start looking for opportunities to give/receive tutoring to fellow students.

**Note:** This platform is a work in progress. Some features may still be under development, and we appreciate your patience as I continue to improve the application.
